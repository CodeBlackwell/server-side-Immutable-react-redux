# server-side-Immutable-react-redux-boilerplate
#### This is a simple app that is meant to show how to wire together ReactJS, Redux, and ImmutableJS being served by an express server.
It is meant to be as barebones as possible as not to overcomplicate things, making it hard to adapt for your own uses. Enjoy :)

## Usage
`npm install / yarn`
`webpack -w --progress`
`nodemon server.js`

##### Inspired by @RemarkableMark
