# server-side-Immutable-react-redux-boilerplate
#### A simple boilerplate demonstrating how to setup an Isomorphic / Universal / server-side rendered application using react, redux, Immutable, express, and webpack

It is meant to be as barebones as possible as not to overcomplicate things, keep things easy to adapt for your own uses. Enjoy :)

## Usage
`npm install / yarn`

`webpack -w --progress`

in another terminal window

`nodemon server.js`
