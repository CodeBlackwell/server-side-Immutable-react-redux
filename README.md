# server-side-Immutable-react-redux
A simple app boilerplate demonstrating how to setup server-side rendering using react, redux, express, and webpack.


#### This is a simple app that is meant to show how to wire together ReactJS, Redux, and ImmutableJS being served by an express server.
It is meant to be as barebones as possible as not to overcomplicate things, making this hard to adapt.

##### Inspired by @RemarkableMark
